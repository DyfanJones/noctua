With most applications that connect to an API, unnecessary exceptions can be returned back to the caller in the case of transient network or service issues. To avoid this `noctua` has implemented a retry method with exponential backoff. This technique increases the reliability of the application with connecting to `AWS Athena`. 

# How to handle `noctua`'s retry?

By default `noctua` performs a retry noisily, this means it will report the exception it has encountered and let the user know how long `noctua` will wait until it retries again. This is reported in the following format:

```r
{expection message} + "Request failed. Retrying in " + {wait time}  + " seconds..."
```

This is to keep the user informed in what `noctua` is doing behind the scenes.

## Configure

By default `noctua` retries 5 times and does it noisily. To configure this, `noctua_options` has been give 2 extra parameters `retry` and `retry_quiet`. `retry` is the number of retries `noctua` will perform. `retry_quiet` tells `noctua` to retry quietly or not.

We can change the default retry settings so that `noctua` will retry 10 times and do it quietly:

```r
noctua_options(retry = 10, retry_quiet = TRUE)
```

If you wish to create your own custom retry function just set the `retry` to 0:

```r
library(DBI)
library(noctua)

# connection to AWS Athena
con = dbConnect(athena())

# Stop noctua retrying
noctua_options(retry = 0)

# build your own custom retry function
custom_retry = function(x){
  # your custom retry method
}

# apply your own retry function
custom_retry(dbGetQuery(con, "select ..."))
```

# Requests

If you wish to increase the retry functionality of `noctua` for example the use of different backoff algorithms, please raise a ticket at [issues](https://github.com/DyfanJones/noctua/issues) or raise a pull request.

# Intro

`noctua` now supports caching. This was inspired by `pyathena`to reduce the cost of using `AWS Athena`. `noctua` however has a slightly different caching method and utilities local caching in `R` environments instead of using AWS `list_query_executions`. This is down to `dbClearResult` clearing `AWS S3`'s `AWS Athena` output when caching is disabled.

## Caching benefits

By caching queries the performance of repeat queries significantly increase. This is because the query is no longer sent to `AWS Athena` instead the QueryID of the repeat query is used to retrieve the `AWS Athena` result from `AWS S3`.

```
library(DBI)
library(noctua)

con = dbConnect(athena())

# Start caching queries
noctua_options(cache_size = 10)

# Upload Data to AWS Athena
dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris, partition = c("Partition" = "01")

# initial query to AWS Athena
system.time(df1 = dbGetQuery(con, "select * from iris"))

# Info: (Data scanned: 3.63 KB)
#   user  system elapsed 
#  0.105   0.004   3.397 

# repeat query to AWS Athena
system.time(df2 = dbGetQuery(con, "select * from iris"))

# Info: (Data scanned: 3.63 KB)
#   user  system elapsed 
#  0.072   0.000   0.348 
```

Here we can see a x10 in performance with repeat queries.

## Caching weakness 

The weakness in caching is when the underlying data is updated. The cache will still only retrieve the previous QueryID. This means that the new updated data won't be return when the caching is being used:

```
# Updating iris table
dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris, append = T, partition = c("Partition" = "02"))

dt5 = dbGetQuery(con, "select * from iris")

# Stop using cache data
RAthena_options()

dt6 = dbGetQuery(con, "select * from iris")

nrow(dt5)
# 150

nrow(dt6)
# 300
```

Sadly the cached query didn't pick up the new data from `iris`.

## Cache memory

The caching method in `noctua` will rememeber previous query ids within each R session, even if you stop and start caching in `noctua_options`.

```
# Start caching
RAthena_options(cache_size = 10)
res1 = dbExecute(con, "select * from iris")

# Stop caching
RAthena_options()
res2 = dbExecute(con, "select * from iris")

# Start caching
RAthena_options(cache_size = 10)
res3 = dbExecute(con, "select * from iris")

# Compare Query ID's
res1@info$QueryExecutionId
# 9a9272f5-0632-4774-9aa9-d07f151dabc5

res2@info$QueryExecutionId
# be12fe0-3ec0-4595-b3e6-b3bf67efa266

res3@info$QueryExecutionId
# 9a9272f5-0632-4774-9aa9-d07f151dabc5
```

We can see that `res1` and `res3` utilise the same QueryID, even tho caching was stopped and started.

## Clear down cache

To clear down the cache just set the parameter `clear_cache` within `noctua_options` to `TRUE`

```
noctua_options(clear_cache = T)
```

# noctua 1.3.0
Updated package version for cran release

# noctua 1.2.1.9004
### Major Change
* `dbWriteTable` now will split `gzip` compressed files to improve AWS Athena performance. By default `gzip` compressed files will be split into 20.

Performance results
```
library(DBI)
X <- 1e8
df <- data.frame(w =runif(X),
                 x = 1:X,
                 y = sample(letters, X, replace = T), 
                 z = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), X, replace = T))
con <- dbConnect(noctua::athena())
# upload dataframe with different splits
dbWriteTable(con, "test_split1", df, compress = T, max.batch = nrow(df), overwrite = T) # no splits
dbWriteTable(con, "test_split2", df, compress = T, max.batch = 0.05 * nrow(df), overwrite = T) # 20 splits
dbWriteTable(con, "test_split3", df, compress = T, max.batch = 0.1 * nrow(df), overwrite = T) # 10 splits
```
AWS Athena performance results from AWS console (query executed: `select count(*) from ....` ):

* test_split1: (Run time: 38.4 seconds, Data scanned: 1.16 GB)
* test_split2: (Run time: 3.73 seconds, Data scanned: 1.16 GB)
* test_split3: (Run time: 5.47 seconds, Data scanned: 1.16 GB)

```
library(DBI)
X <- 1e8
df <- data.frame(w =runif(X),
                 x = 1:X,
                 y = sample(letters, X, replace = T), 
                 z = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), X, replace = T))
con <- dbConnect(noctua::athena())
dbWriteTable(con, "test_split1", df, compress = T, overwrite = T) # default will now split compressed file into 20 equal size files.
```

Added information message to inform user about what files have been added to S3 location if user is overwritting an Athena table.

### Minor Change
* `copy_to` method now supports compress and max_batch, to align with `dbWriteTable`

# noctua 1.2.1.9003
### Bug Fixed
* Fixed bug in regards to Athena DDL being created incorrectly when passed from `dbWriteTable`

# noctua 1.2.1.9002
### Bug Fixed
* Thanks to @OssiLehtinen for identifying issue around uploading class `POSIXct` to Athena. This class was convert incorrectly and AWS Athena would return NA instead. `noctua` will now correctly convert `POSIXct` to timestamp but will also correct read in timestamp into `POSIXct`

* Thanks to @OssiLehtinen for discovering an issue with `NA` in string format. Before `noctua` would return `NA` in string class as `""` this has now been fixed.

### Unit tests
* `POSIXct` class has now been added to data transfer unit test

# noctua 1.2.1.9001
### Bug Fixed
When returning a single column data.frame from Athena, `noctua` would translate output into a vector with current the method `dbFetch` n = 0.

# noctua 1.2.1.9000
### Bug Fixed
Thanks to @OssiLehtinen for identifying issue around `sql_translate_env`. Previously `noctua` would take the default `dplyr::sql_translate_env`, now `noctua` has a custom method that uses Data types from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/data-types.html and window functions from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/functions-operators-reference-section.html

### Unit tests
* `dplyr sql_translate_env` tests if R functions are correct translated in to Athena sql syntax.

# noctua 1.2.1
### New Features:
* Parquet file type can now be compress using snappy compression when writting data to S3.

### Bug fixed
* Older versions of R are returning errors when function `dbWriteTable` is called. The bug is due to function `sqlCreateTable` which `dbWriteTable` calls. Parameters `table` and `fields` were set to `NULL`. This has now been fixed.

# noctua 1.2.0
Updated package version for cran release

# noctua 1.1.0.9001
### Minor Change
* `s3.location` parameter is `dbWriteTable` can now be made nullable

### Backend Change
* helper function `upload_data` has been rebuilt and removed the old "horrible" if statement with `paste` now the function relies on `sprintf` to construct the s3 location path. This method now is a lot clearer in how the s3 location is created plus it enables a `dbWriteTable` to be simplified. `dbWriteTable` can now upload data to the default s3_staging directory created in `dbConnect` this simplifies `dbWriteTable` to :
```
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(noctua::athena())

dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris)
```
### Bug Fix
* Info message wasn't being return when colnames needed changing for Athena DDL

### Unit Tests
* `data transfer` test now tests compress, and default s3.location when transferring data

# noctua 1.1.0.9000
### New Feature
* GZIP compression is now supported for "csv" and "tsv" file format in `dbWriteTable`

### Minor Change
* `sqlCreateTable` info message will now only inform user if colnames have changed and display the colname that have changed

# noctua 1.1.0
* Increment package version from dev version to cran

# noctua 1.0.9000

## New Features
* credentials are now passed through the new `config = list()` parameter is `paws` objects
* `BigInt` are now passed correctly into `integer64`

## Bug
* `AthenaResult` returned: `Error in call[[2]] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable`. The function `do.call` was causing the issue, to address this `do.call` has been removed and the helper function `request` has been broken down into `ResultConfiguration` to return a single component of `start_query_execution`
* All functions that utilise `do.call` have been broken down due to error: `Error in call[[2]] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable`

## Unit Tests
* Added `bigint` to `integer64` in data.transfer unit test

## Minor Change
* dependency `paws` version has been set to a minimum of `0.1.5` due to latest change.

## Major Change
* `data.table` is now used as the default file parser `data.table::fread` / `data.table::fwrite`. This isn't a breaking change as `data.table` was used before however this change makes `data.table` to default file parser.


# noctua 1.0.0
* **Initial RAthena release**

## New Features

### DBI
* `dbConnect` method can use the following methods:
  * assume role
  * aws profile name
  * hard coded aws credentials
  * set credentials in system variables
* Enabled method to upload parquet file format into AWS S3 using `arrow` package
  
### Athena lower level api
* `assume_role` developed method for user to assume role when connecting to AWS Athena
* developed methods to create, list, delete and get AWS Athena work groups
